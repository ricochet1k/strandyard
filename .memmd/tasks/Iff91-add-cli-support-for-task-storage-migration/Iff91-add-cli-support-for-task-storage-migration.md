# Add CLI support for task storage migration

## Summary
We manually moved tasks/roles/templates into .memmd for local storage initialization. Add a first-class command to migrate existing repos without manual moves (including updating git-tracked paths and master lists).

## Context
Provide relevant logs, links, and environment details.

## Impact
Describe severity and who/what is affected.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Define what fixes or mitigations are required.

## Escalation
Tasks are disposable. Use follow-up tasks for open questions/concerns. Record decisions and final rationale in design docs; do not edit this task to capture outcomes.
