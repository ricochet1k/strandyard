# Clarify recurrence anchor flags and help text

## Context
Provide links to relevant design documents, diagrams, and decision records.

## TODOs
- [ ] (role: {{ .Role }}) Implement the behavior described in Context.
- [ ] (role: developer) Add unit and integration tests covering the main flows.
- [ ] (role: tester) Execute test-suite and report failures.
- [ ] (role: master-reviewer) Coordinate required reviews: `reviewer-reliability`, `reviewer-security`, `reviewer-usability`.
- [ ] (role: documentation) Update user-facing docs and examples.

## Subtasks
Use subtasks for work that should be tracked as separate task directories. List them here when useful:
- tasks/Tftao-clarify-recurrence-anchor-flags-and-help-text-subtask/task.md — short description of subtask

## Escalation
Tasks are disposable. Use follow-up tasks for open questions/concerns. Record decisions and final rationale in design docs; do not edit this task to capture outcomes.

## Tasks

- [ ] (subtask: T1dua-draft-recurrence-anchor-flag-alternatives) Draft recurrence anchor flag alternatives
- [ ] (subtask: T6oqp-usability-review-recurrence-anchor-flags) Usability review: recurrence anchor flags
- [ ] (subtask: T7wm3-review-recurrence-anchor-flag-alternatives) Review recurrence anchor flag alternatives
- [ ] (subtask: Tpgq2-reliability-review-recurrence-anchor-flags) Reliability review: recurrence anchor flags

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clear, runnable steps to reproduce locally.
- Tests covering functionality and passing.
- Required reviews completed and blockers cleared.
