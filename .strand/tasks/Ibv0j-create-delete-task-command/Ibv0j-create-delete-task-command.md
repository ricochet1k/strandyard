# Create delete task command

## Summary
We need a CLI command to delete tasks safely (remove directory, clean parent/blocker links, update master lists).

## Subtasks
- [ ] (subtask: Todbi8z) New Task: Design delete task command

## Completion Report
Confirmed that a delete command is missing. Created a design task Todbi8z for a designer to define the command's behavior and safety rules.
