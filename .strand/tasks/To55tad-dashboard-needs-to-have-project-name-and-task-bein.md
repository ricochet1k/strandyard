# Dashboard needs to have project name and task being edited in the route.

## Summary

## Completion Report
Confirmed that the dashboard currently uses query parameters instead of URL routes. Created follow-up implementation tasks: Tcojdpy for client-side routing and Tifug5w for Go server SPA fallback.
