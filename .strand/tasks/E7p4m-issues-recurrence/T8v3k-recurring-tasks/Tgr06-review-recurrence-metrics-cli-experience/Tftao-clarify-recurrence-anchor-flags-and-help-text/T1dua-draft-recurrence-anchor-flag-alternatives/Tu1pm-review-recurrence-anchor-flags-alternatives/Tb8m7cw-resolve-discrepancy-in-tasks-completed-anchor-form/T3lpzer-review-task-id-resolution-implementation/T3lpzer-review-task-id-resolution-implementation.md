# Review task ID resolution implementation plan

## Description
Review the implementation plan in `design-docs/tasks-completed-anchor-resolution.md`.
Ensure the approach for resolving task IDs via the activity log is reliable and handles edge cases (e.g. task not found, multiple completions).

Delegate concerns to the relevant role via subtasks.
