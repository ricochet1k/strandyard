# New Task: Review task ID resolution implementation for reliability

## Description
Review the task ID resolution implementation for reliability concerns, error handling, and robustness. Focus on edge cases like missing task IDs, malformed anchors, and activity log consistency.

Decide which task template would best fit this task and re-add it with that template and the same parent.
