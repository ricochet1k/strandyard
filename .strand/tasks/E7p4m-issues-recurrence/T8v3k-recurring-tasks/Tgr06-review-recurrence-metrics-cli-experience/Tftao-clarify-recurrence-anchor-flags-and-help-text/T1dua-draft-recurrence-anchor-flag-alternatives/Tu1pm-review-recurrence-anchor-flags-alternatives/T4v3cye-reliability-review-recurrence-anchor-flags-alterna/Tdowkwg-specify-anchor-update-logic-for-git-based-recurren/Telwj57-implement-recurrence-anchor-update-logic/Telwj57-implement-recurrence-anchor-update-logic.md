# New Task: Implement recurrence anchor update logic

## Description
Decide which task template would best fit this task and re-add it with that template and the same parent.

## Completion Report
Implemented anchor update logic for all metrics, including 'No-Drift' time logic and git-based 'GetCommitAtOffset'/'GetCommitCrossingLinesThreshold' helpers. Added unit tests in pkg/task/recurrence_test.go.
