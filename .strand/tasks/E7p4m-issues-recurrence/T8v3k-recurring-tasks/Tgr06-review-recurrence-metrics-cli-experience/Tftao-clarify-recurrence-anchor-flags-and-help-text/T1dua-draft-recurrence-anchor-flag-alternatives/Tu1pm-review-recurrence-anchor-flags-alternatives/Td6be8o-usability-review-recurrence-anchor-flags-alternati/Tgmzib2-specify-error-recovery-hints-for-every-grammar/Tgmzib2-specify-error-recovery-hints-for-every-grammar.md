# New Task: Specify error recovery hints for --every grammar

## Description
## Summary
User-facing error messages for the `--every` structured string must include the correct grammar and a relevant example based on the partial input.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Design a set of error messages for common mistakes (e.g., missing 'from', invalid unit, invalid date format).
- Each error message should provide a "Did you mean?" or "Example:" hint.

Decide which task template would best fit this task and re-add it with that template and the same parent.
