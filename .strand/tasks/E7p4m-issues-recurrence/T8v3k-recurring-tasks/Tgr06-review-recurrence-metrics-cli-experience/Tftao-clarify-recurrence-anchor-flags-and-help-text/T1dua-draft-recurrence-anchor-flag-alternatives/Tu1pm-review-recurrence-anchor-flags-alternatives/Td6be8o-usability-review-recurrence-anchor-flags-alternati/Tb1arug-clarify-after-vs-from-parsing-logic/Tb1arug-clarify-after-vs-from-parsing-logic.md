# New Task: Clarify after vs from parsing logic

## Description
## Summary
Define the parsing logic and user-facing distinction between `after <anchor>` and `from <anchor>` in the structured grammar.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Document how `after` and `from` affect the first materialization time.
- Ensure the parser supports both keywords if they are both intended to be supported.

Decide which task template would best fit this task and re-add it with that template and the same parent.
