# New Task: Include unit list and examples in --every help text

## Description
## Summary
Update the help text for the `--every` flag to be more discoverable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Help text lists all valid units (days, weeks, months, commits, lines_changed, tasks_completed).
- Help text provides at least one example for each category (time, git, activity).

Decide which task template would best fit this task and re-add it with that template and the same parent.
