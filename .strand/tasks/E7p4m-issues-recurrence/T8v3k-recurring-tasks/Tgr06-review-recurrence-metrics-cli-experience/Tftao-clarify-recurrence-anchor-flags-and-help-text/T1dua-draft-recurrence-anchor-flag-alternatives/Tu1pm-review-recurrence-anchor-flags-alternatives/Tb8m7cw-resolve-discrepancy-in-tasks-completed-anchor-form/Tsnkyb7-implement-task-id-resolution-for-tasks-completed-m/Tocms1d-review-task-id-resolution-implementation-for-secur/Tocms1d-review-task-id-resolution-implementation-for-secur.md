# New Task: Review task ID resolution implementation for security

## Description
Review the task ID resolution implementation for security concerns. Examine input validation, injection risks with task IDs, and activity log access patterns. Verify no unauthorized access to task data is possible.

Decide which task template would best fit this task and re-add it with that template and the same parent.
