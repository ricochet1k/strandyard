# New Task: Ensure tasks_completed anchor requires completion timestamp metadata

## Description
Decide which task template would best fit this task and re-add it with that template and the same parent.

## Completion Report
Decided the 'implement' template is appropriate for this task since it involves adding validation logic for the tasks_completed anchor. Created new task Tzv10sn-ensure-tasks-completed-anchor-requires-completion with developer role using the implement template. This task will validate that tasks have completion timestamp metadata when using the tasks_completed anchor for recurrence scheduling.
