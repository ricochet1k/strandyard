# Specify anchor error messages

## Context
Provide links to relevant design documents, diagrams, and decision records.

## Description

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clear, runnable steps to reproduce locally.
- Tests covering functionality and passing.
- Required reviews completed and blockers cleared.

- [x] (subtask: Tcsz3) Review alternatives: recurrence anchor error messages
