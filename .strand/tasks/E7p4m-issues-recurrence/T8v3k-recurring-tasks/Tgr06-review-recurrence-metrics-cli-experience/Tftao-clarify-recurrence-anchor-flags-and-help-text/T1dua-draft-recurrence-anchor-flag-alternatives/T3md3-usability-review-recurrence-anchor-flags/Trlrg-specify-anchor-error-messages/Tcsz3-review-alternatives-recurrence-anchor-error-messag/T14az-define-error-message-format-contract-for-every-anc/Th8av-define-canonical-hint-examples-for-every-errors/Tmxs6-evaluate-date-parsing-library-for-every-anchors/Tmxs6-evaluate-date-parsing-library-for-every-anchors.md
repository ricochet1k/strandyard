# Evaluate date parsing library for --every anchors

## Context
Provide links to relevant design documents, diagrams, and decision records.

## Description


## Summary
Research and recommend a date parsing library that supports flexible, human-friendly inputs and is suitable for deterministic CLI parsing.

## Context
Potential requirement: allow relative date expressions in `--every` anchors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Compare at least 2 candidate libraries with pros/cons (Go compatibility, license, determinism, locale behavior).
- Recommend one library and document constraints for CLI usage.

## Escalation
