# Document HEAD-missing behavior in commit-metric defaults

## Context
Provide links to relevant design documents, diagrams, and decision records.

## Description

## Summary
Capture the HEAD-missing/unborn behavior for commit-based recurrence metrics in user-facing docs once wording is finalized.

## Acceptance Criteria
- CLI/docs mention the HEAD requirement for commit-based default anchors.
- Wording aligns with the chosen default-anchor alternative.

## Escalation
Tasks are disposable. Use follow-up tasks for open questions/concerns. Record decisions and final rationale in design docs; do not edit this task to capture outcomes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clear, runnable steps to reproduce locally.
- Tests covering functionality and passing.
- Required reviews completed and blockers cleared.
