# Add Issue and Recurring Task Support

## Summary
Introduce CLI subcommands to add issues and create repeating tasks. Define the metadata and scheduling model, and ensure it integrates with the existing task database and validation workflow.

## Context
The CLI currently manages tasks stored as Markdown with YAML frontmatter. We need a way to add issue-like entries and recurring tasks (e.g., clean up AGENTS.md after a certain number of days or commits) using deterministic, validated metadata.

## Acceptance Criteria
- CLI supports adding issues and recurring tasks via explicit subcommands
- Recurrence metadata is deterministic and validated
- Tasks generated by recurrence appear in master lists as expected
- Documentation covers new commands and examples

## Subtasks
- [x] (subtask: T2c7n) Add Issue Subcommand
- [x] (subtask: T5f2q) Document Recurring Task Commands
- [ ] (subtask: T8v3k) Add Recurring Task Support
