# New Task: Usability review: anchor help text and examples

## Description


## Summary
Perform a usability review of the help text and examples alternatives in `design-docs/anchor-help-text-and-examples-alternatives.md`.

## Description
Review the proposed `--help` text and CLI.md examples from a usability perspective, focusing on:

1. **Scannability**: Can users quickly find the information they need when skimming help output?
2. **Clarity**: Is the distinction between time-based and git-based metrics clear?
3. **Example quality**: Do the examples cover common use cases without overwhelming the user?
4. **Error prevention**: Would the help text prevent common formatting mistakes?

The three alternatives being considered:
- **Alternative A**: Compact one-line help with examples
- **Alternative B**: Grouped help with section headers
- **Alternative C**: Minimal help with reference URL

## Acceptance Criteria
- Usability assessment for each alternative documented
- Recommendation on which alternative to adopt
- Any concerns about user workflows or confusion points documented

Decide which task template would best fit this task and re-add it with that template and the same parent.
