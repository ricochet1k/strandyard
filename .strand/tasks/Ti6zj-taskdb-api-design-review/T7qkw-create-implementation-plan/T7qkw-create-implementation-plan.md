# Create implementation plan

## Context
Provide links to relevant design documents, diagrams, and decision records.

## Description
Based on design decisions, create detailed implementation plan:
- Prioritize changes by risk and dependency
- Identify breaking changes
- Plan migration strategy for existing code
- Define phases of implementation
- Create checklist of all code changes needed
- Identify what can be done incrementally vs. what needs big refactor

## Escalation
Tasks are disposable. Use follow-up tasks for open questions/concerns. Record decisions and final rationale in design docs; do not edit this task to capture outcomes.
