# Identify code to delete

## Context
Provide links to relevant design documents, diagrams, and decision records.

## Description
Create deletion list:
- GetOrCreate and similar methods
- Redundant relationship management functions
- Test code for deleted functionality
- Example code that demonstrates misuse
- Poorly named functions being replaced
- Document why each item is being removed

## Escalation
Tasks are disposable. Use follow-up tasks for open questions/concerns. Record decisions and final rationale in design docs; do not edit this task to capture outcomes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clear, runnable steps to reproduce locally.
- Tests covering functionality and passing.
- Required reviews completed and blockers cleared.
