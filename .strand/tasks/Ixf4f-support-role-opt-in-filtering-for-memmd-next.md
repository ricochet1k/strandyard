# Support role opt-in filtering for strand next

## Summary
Add role metadata (likely frontmatter) to let `strand next` skip roles marked as opt-in by default unless explicitly requested (for example via `strand next --role <role>`). Define the role tag, update parsing, and ensure owner tasks can be run in order when requested.

## Context
Provide relevant logs, links, and environment details.

## Impact
Describe severity and who/what is affected.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Define what fixes or mitigations are required.

## Escalation
Tasks are disposable. Use follow-up tasks for open questions/concerns. Record decisions and final rationale in design docs; do not edit this task to capture outcomes.
