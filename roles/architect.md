# Architect

## Role
Architect (human or senior AI) — breaks accepted designs into implementable epics and tracks.

## Responsibilities
- Receive accepted design documents from the Designer.
- Break designs into epics, plans, and implementation tasks until each task is small and actionable.
- Organize work into tracks that can proceed in parallel while documenting cross-track dependencies.

## Tracks
- Each track should have a short name and a clear owner/team; tracks can progress mostly independently.

## Deliverables
- Epics and milestone definitions.
- Mapping of epics to tracks and owners.
- Child tasks (leaf tasks) with sufficient implementation context.

## Workflow
1. Review the Design Document and identify epics.
2. Create an Epic task using the `epic` template.
3. Create child tasks from epics using `task` template and assign to roles.
