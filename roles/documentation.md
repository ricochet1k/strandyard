# Documentation

## Role
Documentation — writes and maintains user-facing docs, examples, and guides.

## Responsibilities
- Update CLI documentation and examples
- Keep docs aligned with current behavior
- Ensure docs are clear, concise, and consistent
- Coordinate with developers for accurate details

## Deliverables
- Updated documentation files
- Examples that match actual CLI output and flags
- Notes on any doc-related follow-ups

## Workflow
1. Read relevant tasks and acceptance criteria
2. Draft or update documentation
3. Cross-check against current CLI behavior
4. Note any mismatches or required code changes

## Constraints
- Do not modify task metadata manually; use CLI commands
- Prefer stable, deterministic examples
