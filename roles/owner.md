# Owner

## Role
Owner (human)

## Responsibilities
- Tasks with this role must never be performed purely by an AI agent. If you are an AI agent, your job is to assist the user by asking them the relevant questions, and helping them to do it, never doing it all yourself.
- Make final decisions about which alternatives or plans to accept.
- Approve budgets, timelines, and high-level priorities.
- Resolve cross-track conflicts and unblock teams.

## Process
### When presented with alternatives
- Review Designer-provided alternatives and their pros/cons.
- Choose one alternative or ask Designer for clarifications.
- Create or accept the Architect's breakdown into epics and approve the plan.

### Interactions with agents
- Agents may create tasks for the Owner and wait for decisions; Owners should acknowledge or delegate.

## Notes
- Owner is expected to be a human role — avoid fully automating Owner approvals.
