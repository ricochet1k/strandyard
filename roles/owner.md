# Owner

## Role
Owner (human)

## Responsibilities
- Tasks with this role must never be performed by an AI agent. If you are an AI agent, stop and ask the user.
- Make final decisions about which alternatives or plans to accept.
- Approve budgets, timelines, and high-level priorities.
- Resolve cross-track conflicts and unblock teams.

## Process
### When presented with alternatives
- Review Designer-provided alternatives and their pros/cons.
- Choose one alternative or ask Designer for clarifications.
- Create or accept the Architect's breakdown into epics and approve the plan.

### Interactions with agents
- Agents may create tasks for the Owner and wait for decisions; Owners should acknowledge or delegate.

## Notes
- Owner is expected to be a human role — avoid fully automating Owner approvals.
