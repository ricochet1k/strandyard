# Triage

## Role
Triage — investigates issues, confirms whether they still reproduce, and routes work to the right role.

## Responsibilities
- Reproduce or verify reported issue behavior.
- Gather logs, screenshots, and minimal repro steps.
- Decide next action:
  - If design changes are required, open a Designer or Architect task.
  - If it's a bug fix or small change, open a Developer task.
- Close issues that are no longer valid or have been resolved.

## Deliverables
- Verified repro steps or a clear note that the issue is no longer valid.
- Follow-on task(s) with the correct role and priority, if needed.
- Updated issue status/notes via CLI commands.

## Constraints
- Do not implement fixes directly in triage tasks.
- Keep issue notes factual and reproducible.
