# Design task search command

## Context
Define a `memmd search` command for querying tasks by text, metadata, and scopes.

## TODOs
- [ ] (role: {{ .Role }}) Implement the behavior described in Context.
- [ ] (role: developer) Add unit and integration tests covering the main flows.
- [ ] (role: tester) Execute test-suite and report failures.
- [ ] (role: master-reviewer) Coordinate required reviews: `reviewer-reliability`, `reviewer-security`, `reviewer-usability`.
- [ ] (role: documentation) Update user-facing docs and examples.

## Subtasks
Use subtasks for work that should be tracked as separate task directories. List them here when useful:
- tasks/T3n7p-task-search-command-design-subtask/task.md — short description of subtask

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clear, runnable steps to reproduce locally.
- Tests covering functionality and passing.
- Required reviews completed and blockers cleared.
