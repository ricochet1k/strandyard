# Add CLI support for editing task summary/body

## Summary
Manual edits to task markdown are sometimes needed to fix mistakes, but policy requires CLI support. Add a command or flag to update task summary/body safely without hand-editing task files.

## Context
Provide relevant logs, links, and environment details.

## Impact
Describe severity and who/what is affected.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Define what fixes or mitigations are required.

## Escalation
Tasks are disposable. Use follow-up tasks for open questions/concerns. Record decisions and final rationale in design docs; do not edit this task to capture outcomes.
