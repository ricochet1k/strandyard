# Define tasks-completed scope and anchor semantics

## Context
Provide links to relevant design documents, diagrams, and decision records.

## TODOs

- [ ] (role: master-reviewer) Coordinate required reviews: `reviewer-reliability`, `reviewer-security`, `reviewer-usability`.
- [ ] (role: documentation) Update user-facing docs and examples.

## Subtasks
Use subtasks for work that should be tracked as separate task directories. List them here when useful:
- tasks/T3ebv-define-tasks-completed-scope-and-anchor-semantics-subtask/task.md — short description of subtask

## Escalation
If new concerns or decisions arise, create follow-up tasks instead of editing this task.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clear, runnable steps to reproduce locally.
- Tests covering functionality and passing.
