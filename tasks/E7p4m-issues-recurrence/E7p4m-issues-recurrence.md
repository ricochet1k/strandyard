# Add Issue and Recurring Task Support

## Summary

Introduce CLI subcommands to add issues and create repeating tasks. Define the metadata and scheduling model, and ensure it integrates with the existing task database and validation workflow.

## Context

The CLI currently manages tasks stored as Markdown with YAML frontmatter. We need a way to add issue-like entries and recurring tasks (e.g., clean up AGENTS.md after a certain number of days or commits) using deterministic, validated metadata.

## Subtasks

1. [T2c7n-add-issue-command](T2c7n-add-issue-command/T2c7n-add-issue-command.md) - Design and implement the issue subcommand and metadata
2. [T8v3k-recurring-tasks](T8v3k-recurring-tasks/T8v3k-recurring-tasks.md) - Design and implement recurring task scheduling and persistence
3. [T5f2q-docs-issue-recurring](T5f2q-docs-issue-recurring/T5f2q-docs-issue-recurring.md) - Document usage and examples in CLI.md

## Acceptance Criteria

- CLI supports adding issues and recurring tasks via explicit subcommands
- Recurrence metadata is deterministic and validated
- Tasks generated by recurrence appear in master lists as expected
- Documentation covers new commands and examples
